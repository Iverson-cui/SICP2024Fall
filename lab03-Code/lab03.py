# You need to split into two cases, the one where the last digit is used and the one where it is not. In the case where it is, we want to reduce l since we used the last digit, and in the case where it isn't, we do not.
# In the case where we are using the last digit, you need to put the digit back onto the end, and the way to attach a digit d to the end of a number n is 10 * n + d.
